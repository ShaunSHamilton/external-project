### --description--

The `learn-x-by-building-y.md` file is a markdown file that contains the content for your course. You will learn more about this later. For now, learn how to use the UI.

Click the `Run Tests` button again. Then, click the `Console` tab in the bottom panel, expand the test `details`, and follow the instructions.

### --tests--

This is a test that will always fail.

);
```

Click the `Run Tests` button to see two failed tests.

Then, change the sentence `Welcome to freeCodeCampOS!` in the `learn-x-by-building-y.md` file to anything you want to see one test pass.

Finally, check the `Console` tab for further instructions.

### --tests--

You should edit the `Welcome to freeCodeCampOS!` sentence in the `curriculum/locales/english/learn-x-by-building-y.md` file to anything you want.

```js
const { readFile } = await import('fs/promises');
const file = await readFile(
  'curriculum/locales/english/learn-x-by-building-y.md',
  'utf-8'
);
assert.notInclude(file, 'Welcome to freeCodeCampOS!');
```

I always fail ðŸ™ƒ

```js
assert.fail('Click the > button to go to the next lesson');
```
