# freeCodeCampOS

This package runs the environment for courses on freeCodeCamp.org.

See the documentation for more information: https://opensource.freecodecamp.org/freeCodeCampOS/

The course content served on the client is written in Markdown files. The lesson/project tests run on the Nodejs server are written in the same Markdown files.

The `freecodecamp.conf.json` file is used to configure the course, and define the actions taken by the [freeCodeCamp - Courses](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=freeCodeCamp.freecodecamp-courses) extension.
